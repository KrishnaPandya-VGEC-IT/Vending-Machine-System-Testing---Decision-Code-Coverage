# Vending-Machine-System-Testing---Decision-Code-Coverage
The project related to System that is designed for Vending Machine. The goal was to achieve maximum decision coverage for the Java code provided. 


Here are some of the keypoints of the project:

• Built different test cases using Eclemma to test Vending Machine System implemented in Java <p>
• Accomplished 100% Statement coverage and more than 90% Decision coverage except non-reachable branch <p>
• Implemented test cases in Java using Java SE-11
